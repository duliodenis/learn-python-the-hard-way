**Exercise 0** has no code and is an editor and a Python 2.7.x set-up chapter.

As an exercise I installed on [Windows 8.1](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ "Python for Windows"), [MacOS Yosemite (10.10.2)](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/ "Python for Mac"), and finally Lubuntu 14.10 (with sudo apt-get install python).

Testing at the command line of each system with 'python' yielded the following (below example from Windows PowerShell):

> C:\dev\python\learn-python-the-hard-way> python<br>
> Python 2.7.8 (default, Jun 30 2014, 16:08:48) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.


The following 52 exercises that follow will all be done in a text editor, we will run from the command line, we will fix any issue we find, we will repeat until done.

In addition I set-up a [github repo](https://github.com/duliodenis/learn-python-the-hard-way "github repo with all exercises") in order to go between my computers and be able to run the same scripts from all three environments.
